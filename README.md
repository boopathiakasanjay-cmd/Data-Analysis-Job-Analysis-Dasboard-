# Data-Analysis-Job-Analysis-Dasboard-
Thrilled to showcase my latest Excel Business Intelligence project—a comprehensive Job Analysis Dashboard built using advanced Excel capabilities. 📊

I utilized Power Query for data transformation (including replace values, conditional columns, indexing, and column calculations) and Power Pivot with DAX for deep analytical modeling using functions like MEDIAN, CALCULATE, DIVIDE, and relationship-based filtering. ⚙️

The dashboard highlights job median salaries, skill-wise trends, country insights, posting frequency, and health insurance distributions. 🌍

This project reflects my ability to clean data, create optimized data models, and design impactful dashboards that turn data into actionable insights. 💡
